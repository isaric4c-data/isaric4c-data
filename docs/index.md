# ISARIC4C analysis platform: available datasets

This list is for communication within the data team. It will be superceded in due course by a better system.

# Core datasets for linkage to external data sources

These are the datasets for the core studies supported by the ISARIC4C analysis platform. Where possible they should be combined (that is, one long list of patient identifiers from all of these studies) for linkage to the [external data sources] listed below.
